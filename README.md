Documenting my work on 100DaysOfCode with learning Java

Day 1 - Hello World
1. Write a program that prints "Hello World!" to the console
2. Add single line and multi-line comments to your code

Day 2 - Variables and Data Types
1. Declare and initialize variables for various data types including integer (int), floating-point number (double), and string (String). Then, print each variable to the console.

Day 3 - Input and Output
1. Write a program that reads user input and print it to the console.
2. Modify the program to read and print different data type inputs (integers, floating-point numbers, strings)
3. Write a program to read the user input using Scanner class

Day 4 - Basic Arithmetic Operations
1. Write a program that declares two integer variables and perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on them. Print the results to the console.
2. Write a program that calculates the area of a rectangle. Prompt the user to input the length(integer) and width(integer) of the rectangle, calculate the area (length * width), and print the result.
3. Modify the above program to read decimal numbers as the length and width, and output the area to two decimal points

Day 5 - Compound Assignment Operators
1. Write a program that utilizes increment(++) and decrement(--) operators.
2. Write a program that utilizes the following compound operators +=, -=, *=, /=, and %=.
